# Powered Up Hub Setup

When using a [Lego Powered Up Hub](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/hub-88009), this program makes it act like the old [PowerFunctions AAA battery box](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-power-functions-aaa-battery-box-88000).

See (https://pybricks.com/) for documentation on how to install the Pybricks firmware and load this program on the Hub. Be sure to open the settings gear in the (https://code.pybricks.com/) editor and check "Include current program" under Firmware before loading the firmware onto the Hub.
